\chapter{Preface}

I'm a big believer in cheatsheet learning. There are two kinds of knowledge in this world, stuff that you need to memorize and stuff that you need to understand. Names need to be memorized, concepts need to be understood. But you really need both names and concepts. In this book, we'll have a bunch of cheatsheets and we'll explain the concepts in great detail so you can BEAST everything related to JavaScript.

From the Git Parable by Tom:

"Git is a simple, but extremely powerful system. Most people try to teach Git by demonstrating a few dozen commands and then yelling “tadaaaaa.” I believe this method is flawed. Such a treatment may leave you with the ability to use Git to perform simple tasks, but the Git commands will still feel like magical incantations. Doing anything out of the ordinary will be terrifying. Until you understand the concepts upon which Git is built, you’ll feel like a stranger in a foreign land."

\chapter{CoffeeScript}

CoffeeScript sucks. Never use it.

First: What's so bad about Javascript that you need to cover it up with an intermediary layer, like an ugly child?

\begin{itemize}

\item Prototypal inheritance? Just learn it. Or don't use it.

\item `==/===` confusion? `for (var i in something)` breakage? I agree, JS is not a perfect language. I mean, it was only written in 10 days. Is that enough to turn me away from a language? Not really.

\item Curly brackets? Arguable, if you're really about language aesthetics (I'm not). If you really don't like curly brackets, then just use CoffeeScript, but don't actually write any CoffeeScript code except for indentation.

\end{itemize}

Personally, I think that Javascript is a beautiful language (with maybe a few ugly corners) - but that's an essay for another time.

The problem with CoffeeScript is simple and inevitable: Cross referencing generated code to Javascript code to CS is really difficult. Debugging is much slower than debugging straight JS.
